- 'subject' : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
- 'activity' :  Links the class labels with their activity name

Signals produced by a Fast Fourier Transform

-'fBodyAcc.XYZ'
-'fBodyAccJerk.XYZ'

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

-mean(): Mean value
-std(): Standard deviation
-mad(): Median absolute deviation 
-max(): Largest value in array
-min(): Smallest value in array
-sma(): Signal magnitude area
-energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
-iqr(): Interquartile range 
-entropy(): Signal entropy
-arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
-correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
-maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
-meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
-skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
-kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
-bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
-angle(): Angle between to vectors

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

-'gravityMean'
-'tBodyAccMean'
-'tBodyAccJerkMean'
-'tBodyGyroMean'
-'tBodyGyroJerkMean'

The output values of the variables in the script are the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
