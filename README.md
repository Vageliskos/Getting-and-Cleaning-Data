# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
First reads the data after setting up the working directory. Combines xtrain and xtest into one data frame called 'dataset'. Extracts only the mean and std columns from 'dataset' and makes a new set. Fixes the variable names (columns) by giving them descriptive names. Creates the 'subject' and 'activity' columns and adds them in the data set. Combine the 'dataset',the 'subject' and the 'activity' together into one data set and then gives descriptive activity names to the 'activity' column. Finally from the last data set, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
